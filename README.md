# CS-3033-FA18
A repository of student projects from the CS-3033 Web App Development course for the Fall 2018 semester.

Each student should first fork the projet by using the `Fork` button found at the top of the page.

After forking the project, the student should find the forked repository in their own list of repositories.

The student should create or locate a workspace directory and change their working directory to that.

To clone a repo, use the command `git clone https://github.com/username/CS-3033-FA18.git`.

Once the student has cloned the repo, change directory to the project directory.

The status of the directory can be checked with `git status`.

Create a new branch called `master-username` with `git checkout -b master-username`. Please use your own Github username.

The student can now begin editing the local files.

If the student has not configured their Git environment before, they should use the following commands to do so: `git config --global user.email "email"` and `git config --global user.name "name"`.

All changes can be staged with `git add filename` or `git add -A` for all.

Stages changes can be committed with `git commit -m "Commit message."`.

Commits can be pushed with `git push origin master-username`.

Once all commits have been pushed, the student can create a pull request.
